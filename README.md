  <h2>Alright folks, gather 'round...</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Tool Depot of Ankh-Morpork, where we've got... well, tools. Tools for... stuff. 
<br> 
This is a project still under construction, trying to collect all those nifty, little instruments... for, uh, various tasks.</p>
    <h2>Tools in Stock:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/goro-dim/mouse_giggle" class="tool-link">Mouse Giggle</a>: Keeps your screens awake so you can keep an eye on stuff. Useful for trolls on bridge duty or banshees lurking in the Opera House, I suppose.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/goro-dim/DupliClean" class="tool-link">DupliClean</a>: Gets rid of those extra... things in your... uh, scrolls. Faster than a Nac Mac Feegle snatching a pie. Because who needs double trouble in their paperwork, right?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/goro-dim/mac_trickster"> MacTrickster</a>: MacTrickster is a quirky tool that lets you change your computer's MAC address. Perfect for bamboozling network gremlins or just fixing those annoying connection issues with a touch of irony!  </li>        
<!-- Add more tools with similar descriptions and links as needed -->
