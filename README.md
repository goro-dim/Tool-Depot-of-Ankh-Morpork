<br> 
This is a project still under construction, trying to collect all those nifty, little gizmos.</p>
    <h2>Tools in Stock:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/goro-dim/mouse_giggle" class="tool-link">Mouse Giggle</a>: Keeps your screens awake so you can keep an eye on stuff. Useful for trolls on bridge duty or banshees lurking in the Opera House, I suppose.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/goro-dim/DupliClean" class="tool-link">DupliClean</a>: Gets rid of those extra... things in your... uh, scrolls. Faster than a Nac Mac Feegle snatching a pie. Because who needs double trouble in their paperwork, right?</li>
